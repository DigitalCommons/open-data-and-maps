Altered eating may be the result of disease, illness, life-course transitions and/or external contextual issues and may involve time-limted or chronic difficulties with food and eating - see our list of 'who has altered eating'. The Altered Eating Framework addresses the physical to the social and emotional consequences; and our team is developing a menu of interventions to address eating disruption (for example: smell and taste training, cooking workshops, coping tips and hints). The network also considers broader contexual issues that may result in Altered Eating difficulties from source to senses - including climate change impacts on the availability and cost of food, economic and social change, and the sensory experience of 'ultra-processed' foods. The AE Research Network is developing a public interface for the many people whose difficulties with food and eating are under-recognised and unsupported"

He recently completed a project examining the evolution of film and television production in North East England. Using a mixed methods approach including social network analysis, archival research and interviews, Jon traced the growth and success of the region’s TV in the 1980s and 1990s, the impact of Hollywood coming to the North East, and the more recent decline of production in the region to something akin to a branch plant site for programming originated elsewhere. This work contributes to debates about creative industry growth narratives, and evolutionary ideas within economic geography. Jon’s interest in visual methodologies comes in the form of his own use of infographics to communicate economic issues, and using participatory mapping to uncover narratives about the city. Since 2010 Jon has been working with Mike Jeffries (Department of Geography) and Sebastian Messer (Department of Architecture and Built Environment) to understand how skaterboarders, freerunners and other urban sportists appropriate and re-make the city."
