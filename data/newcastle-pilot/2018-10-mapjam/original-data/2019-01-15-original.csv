We send around 500 bikes a year to development projects in Kenya and The Gambia. The bikes are used as part of microfinance programmes, encouraging local people to have a real stake in improving their futures. The bikes needed for this are more robust, basic models, which make it easier for people to maintain and source the spares for them. We also give away hundreds of bikes a year in the North East.  These go to schools, to community groups, individuals on very low incomes including refugees and asylum seekers. Asylum seekers get a very small amount to live on while their case is considered, yet in addition to feeding themselves with this, they also have other costs – typically they have to travel quite large local distances to register with local authorities, meet their case workers, etc. Some days it can mean making the choice between eating or buying the bus ticket to meet these appointments.

The assembly will provide a national forum for anti-austerity views which, while increasingly popular, are barely represented in parliament. A People’s Assembly can play a key role in ensuring that this uncaring government faces a movement of opposition broad enough and powerful enough to generate successful co-ordinated action, including strike action. The assembly will be ready to support co-ordinated industrial action and national demonstrations against austerity, if possible synchronising with mobilisations across Europe."

However, the programme, when provided as an intensive two day course, is also suitable for men, whether abusive and wishing to change their attitudes and behaviour or whether victims of same sex domestic abuse themselves. The Freedom Programme examines the roles played by attitudes and beliefs on the actions of abusive men and the responses of victims and survivors. The aim is to help them to make sense of and understand what has happened to them, instead of the whole experience just feeling like a horrible mess. The Freedom Programme also describes in detail how children are affected by being exposed to this kind of abuse and very importantly how their lives are improved when the abuse is removed. The programme usually lasts for 11 or 12 weeks and is FREE. It provided by hundreds of agencies across the UK. Some of them are rolling so women can join at any time but this varies according to local needs, etc."

We access these varieties through the National Fruit Collection based in Brogdale, Kent.  This collection of varieties has been established and passed down through generations, and in some cases over centuries, but it is not just a curiosity.  It is a legacy of inestimable value bequeathed to us, and it is incumbent upon us to nurture this inheritance and ensure it is available for the benefit of our children and grandchildren and the countless generations beyond them.We intend to continue to run our grafting courses for local groups, whilst enabling previously skilled groups and individuals to build on their new passion by making grafting material available to them.  We are also excited to be commencing pilot projects with local schools with the aim of rolling out a larger project. But our ultimate aim is to establish a living library, a fruit collection for the region, from which we can better support the many individuals and projects who are growing fruit to develop their own collections.  By growing an extensive range we can actively evaluate the viability of these varieties and, more importantly, allow people to try these fruits, further stimulating interest and so appreciating the potential of this tremendous legacy."
