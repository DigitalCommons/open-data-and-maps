This work contributes to debates about creative industry growth narratives, and evolutionary ideas within economic geography.

Collaboratively working across disciplines, she builds and develops prototypes that couple the computational properties of the natural world with matter at far from equilibrium. She calls the synthesis that occurs between these systems and their inhabitants “living” architecture. She is coordinator for the €3.2m Living Architecture project, which is an ongoing collaboration of experts from the universities of Newcastle, UK, the West of England (UWE Bristol), Trento, Italy, the Spanish National Research Council in Madrid, LIQUIFER Systems Group, Vienna, Austria and EXPLORA, Venice, Italy that began in April 2016 and runs to April 2019. It is envisioned as a next-generation, selectively, programmable bioreactor that is capable of extracting valuable resources from sunlight, wastewater and air and in turn, generating oxygen, proteins and biomass. Conceived as a freestanding partition it is composed of bioreactor building blocks (microbial fuel cell, algae bioreactor and a genetically modified processor), which are being developed as standardized building segments, or bricks. Living Architecture uses the standard principles of both photo bioreactor and microbial fuel cell technologies, which are adapted to and combined into a single, sequential hybrid bioreactor system so they will work synergistically together to clean wastewater, generate oxygen, provide electrical power and generate useable biomass (fertilizer)."

We’ve been around since 2006, and generate our own funds through refurbishing donated bikes which we then sell. This is a major part of our charitable objectives, and we provide a low-cost transport solution for thousands of people in the North East. It also raises the money to fund our other activities. We send around 500 bikes a year to development projects in Kenya and The Gambia. The bikes are used as part of microfinance programmes, encouraging local people to have a real stake in improving their futures. The bikes needed for this are more robust, basic models, which make it easier for people to maintain and source the spares for them. We also give away hundreds of bikes a year in the North East.  These go to schools, to community groups, individuals on very low incomes including refugees and asylum seekers. Asylum seekers get a very small amount to live on while their case is considered, yet in addition to feeding themselves with this, they also have other costs – typically they have to travel quite large local distances to register with local authorities, meet their case workers, etc. Some days it can mean making the choice between eating or buying the bus ticket to meet these appointments. A bike solves this, and we’re glad when we can help out like this."
