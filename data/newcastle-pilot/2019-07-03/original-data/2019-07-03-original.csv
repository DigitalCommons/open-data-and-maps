The Station Masters Community Wildlife Garden begins the journey of sourcing for the senses. It provides opportunities and openings for all ages to keep active and connected.
The Yoga Station is about yoga for everybody, but with a difference. We value the evidence of what works, and seek to include those who may need more support to enjoy the benefits of yoga.
The Green Beans Market is a volunteer led enterprise that supports upcycling, thinking, doing - all with a creative focus. It is the only community led market in the region.
The Lamp Light Studio joins together sound and video recording space, with a 'food hub' where we run flavour masterclasses, community food events and help those who have 'altered eating' difficulties when food has lost its joy.
The Station Master's projects are all not for profit. The Centre is supported by Nexus, the Tyne and Wear Transport Authority. And you can reach us by metro!
