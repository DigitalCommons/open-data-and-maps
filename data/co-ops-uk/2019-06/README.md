# Converting Coops UK 2017 open data into Linked Open Data

The process is controlled by Makefiles. GNU make 3.81 is needed:
```
$ make -v
GNU Make 3.81
```
Each time make is run, the file `common.mk` is included autiomatically. 
It contains definitions that work for this dataset, regardless of the edition (see below) of the dataset.
``` make
$ cat common.mk 
# This makefile fragment sets up the things that are common to all editions of the data being generated.
# 
# Makefile fragments to define specific editions go in this directory:
EDITIONS_DIR := editions/

# Everything produced for an edition goes here:
TOP_OUTPUT_DIR := generated-data/$(edition)/

# This is CSV file that is generated by the csv.mk makefile, and is the input to generating Linked Data:
STANDARD_CSV := $(TOP_OUTPUT_DIR)standard.csv

# bin directory for se_open_data scripts.
# If the bin derectory is on your PATH, you don't this:
SE_OPEN_DATA_BIN_DIR := ../../tools/se_open_data/bin/

# lib directory for se_open_data library.
# This is unnecessary if the library is installed as a gem (not yet possible as at April 2018)
SE_OPEN_DATA_LIB_DIR := $(abspath ../../tools/se_open_data/lib/)

# Any CSS files in CSS_SRC_DIR will be deployed to the DEPLOYMENT_SERVER
CSS_SRC_DIR := css/

# A sample of Identifiers (from 'Identifiers' column in STANDARD_CSV)
# to be used to test the deployment:
TEST_INITIATIVE_IDENTIFIERS := R000001 R013429/BD234AA R013429/BH205RQ/2
```

## Editions

The tools can create and deploy different _editions_ of the data.  
The edition is specified on the make command line For example:
```
$ make -f csv.mk edition=final
```
A makefile fragment in the `editions` directory will be included by make. To see the available editions, look in that directory:
```
$ ls editions
final.mk	test2017.mk
```
For example:
``` make
$ cat editions/final.mk 
# Definitions in common.mk can be overridden here

SPARQL_ENDPOINT := http://store1.solidarityeconomy.coop:8890/sparql
```
All fined generated for an editions are stored in a directory for that edition:
```
$ ls generated-data/
final		test2017
```

## Steps in the process

### Create CSV in the standard format
```
$ make -f csv.mk edition=final
```
`csv.mk` controls a pipeline of processes that convert two of the CSV files from Coops UK's Open Data set into a single CSV file in 'standard' format.
The 'standard' format means that the column headings are as expected by the next step of the process:
```
$ head -1 generated-data/final/standard.csv 
Identifier,Name,Description,Legal Forms,Street Address,Locality,Region,Postcode,Country Name,Website,Companies House Number,Latitude,Longitude,Geo Container,Geo Container Latitude,Geo Container Longitide
```

A number of intermediate CSV files are generated, but the final product is the `standard.csv`:
```
$ find generated-data/final
generated-data/final
generated-data/final/csv
generated-data/final/csv/de-duplicated.csv
generated-data/final/csv/fixed-dups.csv
generated-data/final/csv/ignored-duplicates.csv
generated-data/final/csv/merged.csv
generated-data/final/csv/organisations.csv
generated-data/final/csv/outlets.csv
generated-data/final/standard.csv
```

### Generate RDF and HTML from the CSV
As stated in Linked Data Platform Best Practices and Guidelines (W3C Working Group Note 28 August 2014), [predicate URIs should be HTTP URLs](https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp-bp/#predicate-uris-should-be-http-urls):
> URIs are used to uniquely identify resources and URLs are used to locate resources on the Web. That is to say that a URL is expected to resolve to an actual resource, which can be retrieved from the host. A URI, on the other hand, may also be a URL, but it does not have to be; it may refer to something that has no retrievable representation.

> One of the fundamental ideas behind Linked Data is that the things referred to by HTTP URIs can actually be looked up ("dereferenced"). This important principle was originally outlined by Tim Berners-Lee as rule #2 of "the four rules" for linking data [LD-DI]. It is therefore ideal that predicate URIs identify resources with representations that are retrievable. LDP servers should at least provide [RDF-SCHEMA] representations of these predicates where possible.

> Of course, it is also a common practice to reuse properties from open vocabularies that are publicly available. In this case, implementers have no control over the result when attempting to dereference the URI. For this reason, publishers who wish to make their vocabularies useful for linking data should strive to provide a retrievable representation of the properties their vocabularies define. Consequently, implementers are also expected to use this practice as a benchmark for which to judge the efficacy of a vocabulary's use for linking data.

So, we need to generate RDF files to be deployed to the server that allows the URIs to be dereferenced.
We also generate HTML that will be displeyed when these URIs are loaded into a web browser.
```
$ make -f ../../tools/se_open_data/makefiles/generate.mk edition=final
```

### Deploy the generated RDF and HTML to a server

This action will cause a large number of files to be copied to a server.
Depending on how `DEPLOYMENT_RSYNC_FLAGS` have been set up ...
```
$ grep RSYNC editions/final.mk 
DEPLOYMENT_RSYNC_FLAGS := --delete
```
... this may cause files on the server to be deleted. Existing files may be overwritten.
So, it is highly advisable to perform a `dry-run` and examine carefully the commands that would be issued:

```
$ make -f ../../tools/se_open_data/makefiles/deploy.mk edition=final --dry-run
ssh ise-0-matt 'cd /var/www/html/data1.solidarityeconomy.coop/ && mkdir -p coops-uk/2017/'
rsync -avz  --delete generated-data/final/www/doc/ ise-0-matt:/var/www/html/data1.solidarityeconomy.coop/coops-uk/2017/
ssh ise-0-matt 'cd /var/www/html/data1.solidarityeconomy.coop/ && mkdir -p css/coops-uk/2017/'
rsync -avz  --delete generated-data/final/www/css/ ise-0-matt:/var/www/html/data1.solidarityeconomy.coop/css/coops-uk/2017/
```
Note that this assumes that we're using SSH, and that an ssh host has been set up in an [SSH Config file](http://nerderati.com/2011/03/17/simplify-your-life-with-an-ssh-config-file/).
In the example here, that ssh host is called `ise-0-matt`.

Once you're happy that the command is not going to damage your deployment server, you can proceed:
```
$ make -f ../../tools/se_open_data/makefiles/deploy.mk edition=final
```

### Set up content negotiation

This is the glue between the URIs which look like this ...
```
https://w3id.org/coops-uk/2017/R000001
https://w3id.org/coops-uk/2017/R000001/BD39AL/1
https://w3id.org/coops-uk/2017/R000001/BD227HT
```
... and the deployment server at https://data1.solidarityeconomy.coop

We're using [w3id.org](https://w3id.org/) for permanent URIs. 
The content negotiation is configured in the file `https://w3id.org/coops-uk/2017/.htaccess`.
We modify this file by submitting pull requests from our fork of the [w3id.org repository in GitHub](https://github.com/perma-id/w3id.org).
You can view the [source for https://w3id.org/coops-uk/2017/.htaccess](https://github.com/perma-id/w3id.org/blob/master/coops-uk/2017/.htaccess) on GitHub.

At the time of writing, it looks like this:
``` Apache

```
### Test deployment and content negotiation
This will run `curl` commands to fetch URIs, based on a list of identifiers set up in `common.mk`:
```
$ grep IDENT common.mk 
TEST_INITIATIVE_IDENTIFIERS := R000001 R013429/BD234AA R013429/BH205RQ/2
```
Use the `test` goal of the `deploy.mk`makefile:
```
$ make -f ../../tools/se_open_data/makefiles/deploy.mk edition=final test

### Populate the triplestore
We are assuming use of a [Virtuoso triplestore](https://virtuoso.openlinksw.com/rdf/).
The [Virtuoso Bulk RDF Loader](http://vos.openlinksw.com/owiki/wiki/VOS/VirtBulkRDFLoader) is used to load triples into the triplestore.
A directory is prepared and copied across to the Virtuoso server:
```
$ make -f ../../tools/se_open_data/makefiles/triplestore.mk edition=final
Creating files for upload to Virtuoso...
Creating generated-data/final/virtuoso/essglobal_vocab.rdf from http://purl.org/solidarityeconomics/experimental/essglobal/vocab/...

**** The final step is to load the data into Virtuoso with graph named https://w3id.org/coops-uk/2017/:

****	ssh ise-0-admin 'isql-vt localhost dba <password> /home/admin/Virtuoso/BulkLoading/Data/20180419160531/loaddata.sql'
```
You have to do the last step too!

### Test the triplestore
```
$ make -f ../../tools/se_open_data/makefiles/triplestore.mk edition=final test
```

The `test` goal invokes two other goals:

To view the Named Graphs (i.e. datasets) on the triplestore in JSON format:
