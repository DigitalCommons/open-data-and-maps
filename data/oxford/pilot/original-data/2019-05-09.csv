We are also keen to work with LGBTQ+ community activist groups based in Oxford. If this is you, please feel free to email us. 

Oxford SU LGBTQ+ Campaign takes a very active role in student life: We oversee the organisation of LGBTQ+ 101 workshops at approximately half of Oxford colleges. We engage in a broad range of events, including protests and demonstrations, engaging with the local community and hosting talks, panel discussions, round tables, social events, and photo campaigns. We also work with the University's and colleges' administration to improve the lives of LGBTQ+ students. 

One of Campaign’s current priorities is fighting transphobia and improving the living and working conditions of transgender students in Oxford. We have conducted a trans survey based on which we are working towards changing policies at both a university and college level to tackle hate speech both broadly and pertaining to specific LGBTQ+ identities.

The campaign seeks to bring about the necessary changes along  four pathways: farm practice based on agroecology; the introduction of food sovereignty whereby individuals and communities have charge of their own food supply; economic democracy - essentially a tripartite mixed economy, with cooperation and social enterprise key drivers; and respect for traditional knowledge including attitudes towards ownership of land.","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","No","No","No","Yes","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","Food","No","Yes","No","Yes","No","No","No","No","No","No","Yes","No","Loads!  eg Sustain the Alliance for Sustainable Food and Farming; the Pasture Fed Livestock Association, UK Food Group, the Landworkers' Alliance, the European Network for Access to Land, Land Justice. . .

Project SOUP brings together the people behind new community project ideas and the people that want to help make them happen. Together they enable people to support local projects in an effective way via a simple, democratic vote over a delicious dinner, made from surplus food. 
They hold one soup-filling, heart-warming event per Oxford academic term. At each event, 3-4 local social action groups/charities are invited to speak about their work, ‘pitch’ an idea to try and persuade the audience for their vote. After all the votes have been counted, a winner is announced and all the money on the door and extra donations goes directly to them.","Yes","Yes","Yes","No","No","Yes","Yes","Yes","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","Campaigning, Activism & Advocacy","No","No","No","No","No","Yes","No","No","No","No","No","No","Informal:
