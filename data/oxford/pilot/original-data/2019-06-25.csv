We frequently work alongside the Student Union, LGBTQ+ college reps, and the OU LGBTQ+ Society. We have officers for the majority of the specific identities and intersections of the LGBTQ+ umbrella. We are also keen to work with LGBTQ+ community activist groups based in Oxford. If this is you, please feel free to email us. 

Oxford SU LGBTQ+ Campaign takes a very active role in student life: We oversee the organisation of LGBTQ+ 101 workshops at approximately half of Oxford colleges. We engage in a broad range of events, including protests and demonstrations, engaging with the local community and hosting talks, panel discussions, round tables, social events, and photo campaigns. We also work with the University's and colleges' administration to improve the lives of LGBTQ+ students. 

One of Campaign’s current priorities is fighting transphobia and improving the living and working conditions of transgender students in Oxford. We have conducted a trans survey based on which we are working towards changing policies at both a university and college level to tackle hate speech both broadly and pertaining to specific LGBTQ+ identities.

Together they enable people to support local projects in an effective way via a simple, democratic vote over a delicious dinner, made from surplus food. 
They hold one soup-filling, heart-warming event per Oxford academic term. At each event, 3-4 local social action groups/charities are invited to speak about their work, ‘pitch’ an idea to try and persuade the audience for their vote.
