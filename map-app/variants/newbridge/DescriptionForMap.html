        >Deep Adaptation Map: towards a solidarity economy for Newcastle &amp;
        Gateshead</b
      >
    </p>
    <p>(working title)</p>
    <p>
      The map has been initiated by The Newbridge Project, working closely with
      Solidarity Economy Association, as a tool to make visible and strengthen a
      solidarity economy across Newcastle, Gateshead and the wider region.
      (Description of solidarity economy &acirc;&#8364;&brvbar; or key
      principles&acirc;&#8364;&brvbar;)
    </p>
    <p>
      Together we are engaging in an ongoing process of mapping the different
      projects, initiatives and people within Newcastle and Gateshead who are
      already doing things that engage with climate change, environmental and
      social justice. This mapping will allow us all to: recognise and celebrate
      what is already happening in our region; look at what is missing; join the
      dots to create a collaborative and stronger voice; and enable us to better
      share resources and drive forward change.
    </p>
    <p>
      This responsive and collective mapping builds on the conversations and
      outcomes of previous programmes at The Newbridge Project,
      <i>Deep Adaptation</i> and <i>Hidden Civil War</i> [add links], and in
      particular our collective exploration into ideas of Resilience,
      Relinquishment, Restoration and Response-ability. It will also be a
      starting point for us to plan future artistic and community-led activity
      and action in response to pressing social and ecological issues, through
      working closely with people and projects across Newcastle and Gateshead.
      This ongoing conversation will be community-led and non-hierarchical,
      building on peoples&acirc;&#8364;&#8482; experiences of living and working
      locally.
