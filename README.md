# ise-linked-open-data
Implementation of Linked Open Data by the Institute for Solidarity Economics (ISE).

See [ISE strategy for data](http://solidarityeconomics.org/2016/02/16/ise-strategy-for-data/).
Implementing this strategy is work in progress, documented here in this repository's [Wiki](../../wiki) and the [issue tracker](../../issues).

## DCAP-SSE and ESS Global

We are using [DCAP-SSE](http://purl.org/essglobal/wiki) and the ESSGlobal RDF Vocabulary, created by the ESS Global Taskforce. In so doing, we are also vlidating that work, as we are very early adopters. When we encounter issues, these may be raised here, and may also appear in the [ESS Global wiiki](http://www.maltas.org/wiki-essglobal/doku.php?id=process#issues).
