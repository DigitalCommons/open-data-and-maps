# open-data-and-maps
Linked Open Data and geographic maps for the Solidarity Economy produced by the [Solidarity Economy Association](https://www.solidarityeconomy.coop/).

See [ISE strategy for data](http://solidarityeconomics.org/2016/02/16/ise-strategy-for-data/).
Implementing this strategy is work in progress, documented here in this repository's [Wiki](../../wiki) and the [issue tracker](../../issues).

## DCAP-SSE and ESS Global

We are using [DCAP-SSE](http://purl.org/essglobal/wiki) and the ESSGlobal RDF Vocabulary, created by the ESS Global Taskforce. In so doing, we are also validating that work, as we are very early adopters. When we encounter issues, these may be raised here, and may also appear in the [ESS Global wiki](http://www.maltas.org/wiki-essglobal/doku.php?id=process#issues).
