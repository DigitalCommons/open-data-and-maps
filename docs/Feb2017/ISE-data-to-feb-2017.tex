\maketitle

The Institure for Solidarity Economics has been working on Linked Open Data for the Solidarity Economy,
producing an experimental dataset of UK co-ops, and an application to view the co-ops on a geographical map.
The map also provides as way to browse educational material about the Linked Open Data.

This document outlines that work, and is based on a presentation given at the Open:2017, Platform Co-operatives (\url{https://2017.open.coop/}) conference in London, February 17, 2017.
