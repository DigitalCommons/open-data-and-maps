\maketitle

The Institute for Solidarity Economics has been working on Linked Open Data for the Solidarity Economy,
producing an experimental dataset of UK co-ops, and an application to view the co-ops on a geographical map.
The map also provides as way to browse educational material about the Linked Open Data.

This document describes the work to date.
It is based on a presentation given at the Open:2017,
Platform Co-operatives (\url{https://2017.open.coop/}) conference in London, February 17, 2017.

Our aim is to support the Solidarity Economy movement through education, research, and finding opportunities for collaboration.
What we mean by the Solidarity Economy is a grassroots movement that is building a fair and ecological alternative to Capitalism.

\subsection*{Why data?}
Data fuels the World Wide Web -- they are many examples of the power of data. 

One if the goals of the Institute for Solidarity Economics is to make it easier to discover the initiatives that are part of the Solidarity Economy.
An obvious thing to do is to put those initiatives on a geographic map.
But the data descrining the initiatives must come before the map. A simple geographic may provides a view onto the data, and other simple views (like an alphabetic directory) also have their uses.

We also can see a need for applications that do more than provide a view of SE initiatives -- applications that help the SE to operate.
Of course, these to require data.
It is becasue of this fundamental dependency on data that ISE decided to take a closer look at it.

\subsection*{Social considerations}
Data ownership is power. The social issues around this power need careful consideration.

By publishing data about something, you are making claims about that thing, and the actual 'owners' of that thing may disagree with the claims you are making.
This issue can be avoided if the 'owners' of the thing are able to publish their own data.
So it is important that any technology used for publishing and accessing data allows the actual owner to publish their own data.

Because the publisher of data is the one who is making a claim about the things that their data describes,
it is important that the technology chosen allows users of that data to see who is publishing the data, who is making these claims.
For example, if ISE publishes data about initiatives within the Solidarity Economy, 
then ISE is claiming that each if these initiatives satisfies ISE's view of what it means to be in the Solidarity Economy.
Other people may have a slightly different view of which initiatives should be regards as \textit{in} or \textit{out} of the SE.
It is therefore important that it is possible to identify \textit{who} is making the claims expressed in the data.
